# html-projects
Honestly didn't think I'd enjoy HTML but learning it has given me a new appreciation for webdev- it's hard! I am still working on flex box and wanting to move onto more advanced stuff hopefully.
Most of these are from school and my first try at some of these projects, so I am sorry if some are hard on the eyes. Honestly seeing how some came out was a good laugh!

Enjoy :)
